i am learning to code via the gymnasium & i'll be posting my assignments here for sampling.
so far i have learned basic html and basic styling through css
im need a better grasp of utilizing things like inline, block & padding to style & adjust

feel free to leave any suggestions or tips

i chose for my content to be about my sorority Tau Beta Sigma, National Honorary Band Sorority Inc.
i've included basic information & basic links to some things i think are important and stand on their own.
